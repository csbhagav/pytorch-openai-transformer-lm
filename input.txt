IT 'S SO DARK THAT FOR A WHILE - JUST HOW LONG I DO N'T know - I think I 'm still unconscious . </s>
Then , slowly , it comes to me that unconscious people do n't have a sensation of movement through the dark , accompanied by a faint , rhythmic sound that can only be a squeaky wheel . </s>
And I can feel contact , from the top of my head to the balls of my heels . </s>
I can smell something that might be rubber or vinyl . </s>
This is not unconsciousness , and there is something too ... too what ? </s>
Too rational about these sensations for it to be a dream . </s>
Then what is it ? </s>
Who am I ? </s>
And what 's happening to me ? </s>
The squeaky wheel quits its stupid rhythm and I stop moving . </s>
There is a crackle around me from the rubbersmelling stuff . </s>
A voice : " Which one did they say ? " </s>
A pause . </s>
Second voice : " Four , I think . </s>
Yeah , four . " </s>
We start to move again , but more slowly . </s>
I can hear the faint scuff of feet now , probably in soft - soled shoes , maybe sneakers . </s>
The owners of the voices are the owners of the shoes . </s>
They stop me again . </s>
There 's a thump followed by a faint whoosh . </s>
It is , I think , the sound of a door with a pneumatic hinge being opened . </s>
What 's going on here ? </s>
I yell , but the yell is only in my head . </s>
My lips do n't move . </s>
I can feel them - and my tongue , lying on the floor of my mouth like a stunned mole - but I ca n't move them . </s>
The thing I 'm on starts rolling again . </s>
A moving bed ? </s>
Yes . </s>
A gurney , in other words . </s>
I 've had some experience with them , a long time ago , in Lyndon Johnson 's shitty little Asian adventure . </s>
It comes to me that I 'm in a hospital , that something bad has happened to me , something like the explosion that almost neutered me twenty - three years ago , and that I 'm going to be operated on . </s>
There are a lot of answers in that idea , sensible ones , for the most part , but I do n't hurt anywhere . </s>
Except for the minor matter of being scared out of my wits , I feel fine . </s>
And if these are orderlies wheeling me into an operating room , why ca n't I see ? </s>
Why ca n't I talk ? </s>
A third voice : " Over here , boys . " </s>
My rolling bed is pushed in a new direction , and the question drumming in my head is What kind of a mess have I gotten myself into ? </s>
Does n't that depend on who you are ? </s>
I ask myself , but that 's one thing , at least , I find I do know . </s>
I 'm Howard Cottrell . </s>
I 'm a stock broker known to some of my colleagues as Howard the Conqueror . </s>
Second voice - LRB - from just above my head - RRB - : " You 're looking very pretty today , Doc . " </s>
Fourth voice - LRB - female , and cool - RRB - : ' It 's always nice to be validated by you , Rusty . </s>
Could you hurry up a little ? </s>
The baby - sitter expects me back by seven . </s>
She 's committed to dinner with her parents . " </s>
Back by seven , back by seven . </s>
It 's still the afternoon , maybe , or early evening , but black in here , black as your hat , black as a woodchucks asshole , black as midnight in Persia , and what 's going on ? </s>
Where have I been ? </s>
What have I been doing ? </s>
Why have n't I been manning the phones ? </s>
Because it 's Saturday , a voice from far down murmurs . </s>
You were ... were ... </s>
A sound : WHOCK ! </s>
A sound I love . </s>
A sound I more or less live for . </s>
The sound of ... what ? </s>
The head of a golf club , of course . </s>
Hitting a ball off the tee . </s>
I stand , watching it fly off into the blue ... </s>
I 'm grabbed , shoulders and calves , and lifted . </s>
It startles me terribly , and I try to scream . </s>
No sound comes out ... or perhaps one does , a tiny squeak , much tinier than the one produced by the wheel below me . </s>
Probably not even that . </s>
Probably it 's just my imagination . </s>
I 'm swung through the air in an envelope of blacknessHey , do n't drop me , I 've got a bad back ! </s>
I try to say , and again there 's no movement of the lips or teeth ; my tongue goes on lying on the floor of my mouth , the mole maybe not just stunned but dead , and now I have a terrible thought , one that spikes fright a degree closer to panic : What if they put me down the wrong way and my tongue slides backward and blocks my windpipe ? </s>
I wo n't be able to breathe ! </s>
That 's what people mean when they say someone swallowed his tongue , is n't it ? </s>
Second voice - LRB - Rusty - RRB - : " You 'll like this one , Doc , he looks like Michael Bolton . " </s>
Female doc : " Who 's that ? " </s>
Third voice - sounds like a young man , not much more than a teenager : " He 's this white lounge singer who wants to be black . </s>
I do n't think this is him . " </s>
What if I 'm dead ? </s>
What if this is what death is like ? </s>
It fits . </s>
It fits everything with a horrid prophylactic snugness . </s>
The dark . </s>
The rubbery smell . </s>
Nowadays I am Howard the Conqueror , stock broker extraordinaire , terror of Derry Municipal Country Club , frequent habitue ' of what is known at golf courses all over the world as the Nineteenth Hole , but in '71 I was part of a medical assistance team in the Mekong Delta , a scared kid who sometimes woke up wet - eyed from dreams of the family dog , and all at once I know this feel , this smell . </s>
Dear God , I 'm in a body bag . </s>
First voice : " Want to sign this , Doc ? </s>
Remember to bear down hard - it 's three copies . " </s>
Sound of a pen , scraping away on paper . </s>
I imagine the owner of the first voice holding out a clipboard to the woman doctor . </s>
Oh dear Jesus let me not be dead ! </s>
I try to scream , and nothing comes out . </s>
I 'm breathing , though ... are n't I ? </s>
I mean , I ca n't feel myself doing it , but my lungs seem okay , they 're not throbbing or yelling for air the way they do when you 've swum too far underwater , so I must be okay , right ? </s>
Except if you 're dead , the deep voice murmurs , they would n't be crying out for air , would they ? </s>
No - because dead lungs do n't need to breathe . </s>
Dead lungs can just kind of ... take it easy . </s>
Rusty : " What are you doing next Saturday night , Doc ? " </s>
But if I 'm dead , how can I feel ? </s>
How can I smell the bag I 'm in ? </s>
How can I hear these voices , the Doc now saying that next Saturday night she 's going to be shampooing her dog , which is named Rusty , what a coincidence , and all of them laughing ? </s>
If I 'm dead , why are n't I either gone or in the white light they 're always - talking about on Oprah ? </s>
There 's a harsh ripping sound and all at once I am in white light ; it is blinding , like the sun breaking through a scrim of clouds on a winter day . </s>
I try to squint my eyes shut against it , but nothing happens . </s>
